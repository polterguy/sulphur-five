# Sulphur Five - Secure file sharing for everyone

Sulphur Five is an Open Source file sharing module for [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive), that allows you
to cryptographically secured share files with your friends, family, and colleagues. When you upload a file, you can choose to either mark it
as _"private"_, _"protected"_ or _"public"_. A private file is only accessible for yourself. A protected file can be accessed by all other
users in the system. A public file is accessible for everyone, including randomly visiting guests.

## Hashtagging your files

Often it can be difficult to categorise a file into a single folder. Therefor we have completely eliminated that problem, by putting all
your files into a single virtual folder, and rather allow you to #hashtag your files, as you see fit. This allows you to put a single file into
multiple categories, according to its relevance.

If you see the video file that is shared in the above screenshot for instance, it is hashtagged with three different tags.

* #video
* #CC - Implying Commons Creative
* #free

This allows you to more easily find your files later, by searching for a file, according to its tag, instead of having to browse through multiple folders.
