# Sulphur Five - Secure file sharing for everyone

Sulphur Five is an Open Source file sharing module for [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive), that allows you
to cryptographically secured share files with your friends, family and colleagues. When you upload a file, you can choose to either mark it
as _"private"_, _"protected"_ or _"public"_. A private file is only accessible for yourself. A protected file can be accessed by all other
users in the system. A public file is accessible for everyone, including randomly visiting guests.
